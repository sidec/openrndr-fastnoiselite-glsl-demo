Port based on FastNoiseLite [C implementation](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite/blob/master/C/FastNoiseLite.h])

## Gradle tasks
 - `run` runs the TemplateProgram

 - `zipDistribution` creates a zip file containing the application jar and the data folder
 - `jpackageZip` creates a zip with a stand-alone executable for the current platform (works with Java 14 only)
